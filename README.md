A home isn't a home at its beginning, it's just a house. What makes it a home? Individuals who stay in it and spend their lifetime, no matter whether it is situated in a city or a country area make it a home. Since a home carries a lot of emotional feelings with it, it is a duty of the constructors to develop one that lives to the dreams of its owners.
